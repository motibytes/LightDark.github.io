[3:59 PM]

im really really satisfied with how it turned out
[4:00 PM]
especially because different people will likely have very different experiences with it
[4:01 PM]
based on whether or not they figured out how to "navigate"
[4:01 PM]
whether or not they went through it more then once
[4:01 PM]
whether or not they realized that there are sometimes multiple choices

I think the
The unfortunate user that clicks "These Words" first will I think end up at
"The Mystery Is The Question"
"The Question Is the Mystery"
loop and believe they reached the end

But I thought for about 3 seconds and said there must be two paths out of there

but that's not true, all paths can take you to 'What is Within The", even that pathway

honestly its a great example of art gameified

dude YES
[4:05 PM]
it makes me kinda think about how there are different branches of thought that can lead you to ask the same questions
[4:06 PM]
but some of those pathways you might get stuck in for longer until you accidentally stumble out

before finishing yesterday, I researched art and found out that people have been making gamified art like this adn they call it "net.art" [first coincidence, I had acquired the .art domain]

then I found the guy who basically is at the top of the top of net.art and was one of the og og's
[4:08 PM]
and I found his site

Big Papi ã€° attn ã€° Potassium CFO â€” Today at 4:08 PM
Whhhaaaat?

Low Key DivenieðŸ§žâœ¨SorceRawr.com â€” Today at 4:08 PM
and I found his homework solution he submitted to "Introduction to Computing in the Arts'

Big Papi ã€° attn ã€° Potassium CFO â€” Today at 4:08 PM
Damn you invented something without knowing someone else invented it

Low Key DivenieðŸ§žâœ¨SorceRawr.com â€” Today at 4:08 PM
I hadn't gotten to explain that part yet
[4:10 PM]
his homework solution wrecked my world.
It is formatted JUST like my project. He had the same concept in mind.

But his project makes endless javascript popups that shout messages at you with no way to cancel.

While I had 100 important tabs open

So it was like I was getting psychologically 'attacked' and 'physically attacked' both at once, the site was threatening to crash chrome, and the site was crashing my originality'
but at the same time, I realized that if I created basically the same or similar thing as the top artist in an entire space, then I, perhaps, should have absolutely no question that I am of this breed
[4:12 PM]
I'm planning to try to disrupt that space(edited)
[4:12 PM]
I've never 'disrupted a space' before in the way i intend to(edited)

'You ARE this space... And you never even knew it
You are like the professor in Gilligans Island'

  that's my sanity right there
[4:14 PM]
you right. I'm not trying to invade their space, my island, is coming to show that im a neighbor
