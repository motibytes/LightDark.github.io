Melanie,

As I can see your focus on expressing love through code and believe you could appreciate this,
I'd like to share with you the project I just completed. https://lightdark.art/

It's my first project as an artist, as I just unblocked myself a few weeks ago. I didn't even know digital art existed as it does until that project was nearly complete.

My description of the project and future focuses to be this for now,
"I am interested in 'using a system of hyperlinks',
not necessarily in the sense of expressing extended meaning through the structure of the system,

but rather in using this system to create the 'illusion of magic',
that words change and transform through being interacted with,
as well as giving a subjective experience to each user.

This was the intention I put into building this unnamed piece."

Blessings to you Melanie,
-James Bytes
