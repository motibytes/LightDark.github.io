I am interested in 'using a system of hyperlinks',
not necessarily in the sense of expressing extended meaning through the structure of the system,

but rather in using this system to create the 'illusion of magic',
that words change and transform through being interacted with,
as well as giving a subjective experience to each user.

This was the intention I put into building this unnamed piece.

I would be interested in connecting with a collective if you happened to know where to point me.
