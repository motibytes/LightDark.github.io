There is a new area of digital art that I want to see,
that uses a hyperlink system in a way that was possible from the inception of this technology,
not in the sense of expressing meaning through digital presentation,
but using this system to create the 'illusion of magic', that words change and transform through being interacted with.

I have created something with this intention at
 https://lightdark.art/

Thanks,
