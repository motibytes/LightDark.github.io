I was perusing your site as it was posted on irrational.org, and find it to be a bit 'irrational'. 
At first I thought it might be a faux site until I saw it was being regularly updated, and the only red flag that points towards a strange dystopian vibe it gives off is the reference to"The Society" in some of the legal documents. 
Surely this is the image of some form of 'topia' in which a company sells plots of land to civilians? Or is your company the real deal? 
Anyway nice to meet you, today I published my first work, https://lightdark.art/startand if you are indeed in an art collective, would you consider showing me the door into that collective, or forwarding my work to someone who you think might be interested in it?
