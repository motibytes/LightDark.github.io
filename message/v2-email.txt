There is a new area of digital art that I am interested in seeing come into fruition,
that uses a hyperlink system in a way that was possible from the inception of this technology,
not in the sense of expressing meaning through digital presentation,
but using this system to create the 'illusion of magic', where in words change and transform through being interacted with.

I have created something with this intention at
https://lightdark.art/ that I wanted to share.

I would be interested in connecting with a collective if you happened to know where to point me.

Thanks,
James Bytes
